Privacy Policy — Gmail Label Organizer
Last updated: February 2026
Gmail Label Organizer is a Chrome extension that uses AI to organise your Gmail inbox. This policy explains what data is accessed and how it is handled.
Data we collect
We collect nothing. The extension has no servers, no database, and no analytics.
Data accessed during normal use
To function, the extension accesses the following data temporarily in your browser:

Gmail metadata — subject lines, sender names, dates, and email snippets are read from your Gmail account via the Gmail API to design a label structure. This data is sent directly from your browser to Anthropic's API for analysis and is never stored, logged, or transmitted anywhere else.
Anthropic API key — stored locally in your browser's extension storage (chrome.storage.sync) so you do not need to re-enter it each session. It is never sent to anyone except Anthropic's API directly from your browser.

Data sharing
No data is shared with any third party except:

Google — via the Gmail API, to read your email metadata and apply labels on your behalf
Anthropic — your email metadata is sent to Anthropic's API (api.anthropic.com) using your own API key to generate label suggestions. Anthropic's privacy policy applies to this data: https://www.anthropic.com/privacy

Data retention
No data is retained. All email data processed during a session exists only in browser memory and is discarded when the session ends.
Your controls

You can revoke Gmail access at any time via your Google Account permissions page
You can delete your API key from the extension's options page at any time
Uninstalling the extension removes all locally stored data
